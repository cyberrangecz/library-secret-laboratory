Sauronia gonna rule us all!!!

If I ruled the world, even just for one day, no one would suffer.

Today, there are people in the world who don't have basic necessities, such as somewhere to sleep. I strongly believe you don't even have to rule the world to change it. A small difference can mean a lot more than you think. One example of this is my friends and I sacrifice our recesses in school to make milk bag mat beds; we cut the milk bags and tie them into yarn and crochet them into a large mat, which is then given to the people of Haiti who don't have anywhere to sleep. Even though this is only a small difference, it means a whole lot to others.

If I ruled the world, the changes would be drastic. There would be equality to every single person. No one would be treated differently for their race, religion or gender; everyone would look past each other's differences and accept people for who they are, and not someone who they are trying to be. I strongly believe the only way to make this realistic is education. Educating the population is very important to me. Without education, we will never learn from our mistakes and are bound to repeat them.

The last, and the most vitally important, thing I would do if I ruled the world is the way everyone would live by the words "do unto others as I have done unto you," which is also known as the golden rule. With this rule, there would be fairness and equality for every single person in the world.

So you see, you don't need to rule to change it, but rather make little changes, as I have done. Each and every single one of us has the potential to make little changes that impact others more than you could ever imagine.

In the end, what you should take out of this is to remember and live your life by the famous words of Mahatma Gandhi: "Be the change you wish to see in the world."
